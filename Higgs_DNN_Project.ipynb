    "# What is the Higgs boson?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Higgs boson is a fundamental particle predicted by the Standard Model. It is a manifestation of the Higgs field, which gives mass to the fundamental particles. \n",
    "However, it is incredibly hard to produce. At the LHC, a Higgs particle is produced about once every 10 billion collisions! \n",
    "This tiny fraction makes it very difficult to detect. \n",
    "Nevertheless, after years of data collection, the Higgs boson was finally discovered in 2012 by CMS and ATLAS experiments at CERN. In this tutorial, we shall be following their example."

    "The Higgs has a very short lifetime, on the order of \\(10^{-22} \\, \\text{s}\\). It decays almost instantaneously after production, so there is no hope of directly detecting the particle. Nevertheless, we can use the Standard Model to predict its decay products: photons, \\(Z\\)-bosons, quarks, etc., each with different probabilities. These **decay channels** can be used to identify the Higgs boson. \n",
